# Project One

A comprehensive full-stack application showcasing modern web development practices.

## Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, performant applications using React, TypeScript, and Node.js. It features real-time updates, secure authentication, and a clean, intuitive user interface.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data synchronization
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with seamless desktop experience
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle size and lazy loading

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Vercel, Railway

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the main challenges was implementing real-time updates without overwhelming the server. I solved this by implementing a debounced WebSocket connection with automatic reconnection logic.

## Results

The application handles over 1000 concurrent users with sub-100ms response times.
